# Coding-Foundations-Project

A replica of the CodePen.io homepage â€“ landing page section to demonstrate that I've learnt the frontend coding foundations: HTML 5, CSS and FlexBox.

## Project requirements

The requirements can be found [here](https://devcamp.com/trails/digital-foundations/campsites/298/guides/digital-and-coding-literacy-capstone-project), but in short.

- Navbar that includes "Pens, Projects, Posts, Collections, and Spark with a down chevron (does not need to actually dropdown).
- Images - use available tools to recreate colors, etc.
- Don't worry about replicating any functionality features such as drop-down, scrolling, etc. Simply replicate the landing page.

The output should look something like this:
